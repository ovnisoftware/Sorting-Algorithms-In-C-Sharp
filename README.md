1. Selection_Sort - Traverses an array of integers, identifies the smallest integer and swaps it with the element at the far left in the zero index position.  
SelectionSort.cs
 
2. Bubble Sort - Highest numbers are bubbled to the right  
BubbleSort.cs
 
3. Cocktail Sort - Sorts in both directions on each pass through the list (Smallest on left, largest on right)  
CocktailSort.cs

4. Insertion Sort - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time starting on the left with smallest numbers.  
InsertionSort.cs

5. Bucket_Sort - Bucket sort breaks a list down into sub-lists, another algorithm sorts the sub-lists and the buckets are combined to return a fully sorted list  
BucketSort.cs

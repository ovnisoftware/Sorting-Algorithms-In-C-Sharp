1. Selection_Sort - Traverses an array of integers, identifies the smallest integer and swaps it with the element at the far left in the zero index position.
 - Selection_Sort.cs
 
2. Bubble Sort - Highest numbers are bubbled to the right
 - Bubble_Sort.cs
 
3. Cocktail Sort - Sorts in both directions on each pass through the list (Smallest on left, largest on right)
 - Cocktail_Sort.cs

4. Insertion Sort - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time starting on the left with smallest numbers.
 - Insertion_Sort.cs

5. Bucket_Sort - Bucket sort breaks a list down into sub-lists, another algorithm sorts the sub-lists and the buckets are combined to return a fully sorted list
 - Buckeet_Sort.cs
